[🔗 Live demo](TODO)

## How to install and run

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Specifications:

✔️ Does SSR based on data provided by CMS (CMS gives a url, and a JSON that describes what should be rendered)

✔️ API responses are validated, and error is displayed when needed.

✔️ Responsive UI.

✔️ Uses Next.js + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.

## Note about Tailwind CSS:

I've used tailwind mostly to test it. Also it makes making responsive layouts easy,
and it enforces UI consistency. I think it's great for creating layouts, but not that
great for creating reusable components since code can get a little messy.
